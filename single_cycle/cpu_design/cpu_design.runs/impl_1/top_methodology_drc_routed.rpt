2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_cpu_top/u_Control/alu_op_reg[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_cpu_top/u_Control/alu_op_reg[0]/CLR, u_cpu_top/u_Control/alu_op_reg[1]/CLR, u_cpu_top/u_Control/alu_op_reg[2]/CLR, u_cpu_top/u_Control/alu_op_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_cpu_top/u_PC/pc[31]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_cpu_top/u_PC/flag_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
